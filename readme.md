### XProxy: Usage Guide
Introduction
XProxy is a versatile proxy solution that offers both server and client components. To configure and run the server and client programs effectively, you'll need to pass a configuration file at the startup using the -c command followed by the configuration file's path. Moreover, both the server and client programs support Lua scripting, enabling users to customize and enhance functionality through Lua scripts.

Server Configuration
To initiate the XProxy server, follow these steps:

Download and Installation: Obtain the XProxy server package from the official repository or website. Install the server on your preferred platform.

Configuration File: Create a configuration file (e.g., server_config.ini) with the necessary settings for the server. Configure aspects such as port numbers, protocols, logging details, etc.

Using Command Line: To start the server, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
```
xproxy_server -c /path/to/server_config.ini
```
Lua Scripting: Enhance server functionality by using Lua scripts. Create or modify Lua scripts and specify their usage within the server configuration file to add custom features or manipulate server behavior.

Client Configuration
To set up and run the XProxy client, follow these steps:

Download and Installation: Obtain the XProxy client package from the official repository or website. Install the client on your desired platform.

Configuration File: Prepare a configuration file (e.g., client_config.ini) specifying client settings, such as server address, port, authentication details, etc.

Using Command Line: Initiate the client using the command:

bash
Copy code
```
xproxy_client -c /path/to/client_config.ini
```
Utilizing Lua Scripts: Similar to the server, leverage Lua scripting in the client to modify or extend its functionalities. Configure the client to use Lua scripts by referencing them in the client's configuration file.

Lua Scripting
Lua scripts can be utilized on both the server and client sides to customize and augment functionality. To make the most of Lua scripting:

Create Scripts: Develop Lua scripts tailored to your specific needs, manipulating various aspects of the server or client behavior.

Integrate with Configuration: Specify the usage of Lua scripts within the respective configuration files for the server and client. This allows the programs to execute the Lua scripts as required.

Scripting Capabilities: Lua scripting offers extensive capabilities to modify behaviors, handle events, and extend functionalities. Refer to Lua documentation for detailed guidance on script creation and usage.

Conclusion
XProxy's server and client programs can be configured and controlled effectively through configuration files passed during startup via the -c command. Additionally, the support for Lua scripting adds an extra layer of customization and extensibility to both the server and client components, allowing users to tailor functionality to their specific requirements.

For detailed instructions, examples, and community support regarding configuration setup, Lua scripting, or any other queries, refer to the official XProxy documentation or community forums.

Always ensure that the provided configuration files and Lua scripts comply with security measures and best practices to maintain a secure networking environment.

In summary, XProxy, with its configuration flexibility and Lua scripting support, empowers users to create personalized and efficient proxy solutions catering to diverse networking needs.


### XProxy: Sample Configuration Files
Server Configuration File Example (server_config.ini)
```ini
host = 0.0.0.0
port = 8888
allow_port_max_range = 10100
allow_port_min_range = 10000
lua_file_path = /home/zhd/jack/xproxy/test.lua
; network_interface = lo
```
* host: Specifies the host IP address where the server listens for incoming connections.
* port: Defines the port number on which the server operates.
* allow_port_max_range / allow_port_min_range: Sets the range of ports available for proxy connections.
* lua_file_path: Indicates the file path for the Lua script to be used by the server.
* network_interface: Optional parameter to specify the network interface (commented out in this example).
Client Configuration File Example (client_config.ini)
```ini
server_host = 127.0.0.1
server_port = 8888
reconnect_interval = 3
; network_interface = lo

[SSH]
type = TCP
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 22
remote_port = 10001

[WEB]
type = TCP
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 80

[TEST]
type = TCP
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 8889
```
* server_host: Specifies the host IP address of the XProxy server to which the client connects.
* server_port: Defines the port number on which the XProxy server operates.
* reconnect_interval: Indicates the time interval in seconds for the client to attempt reconnection if the connection is lost.
* network_interface: Optional parameter to specify the network interface (commented out in this example).
The client configuration file also includes sections for defining different types of proxy connections (e.g., SSH, WEB, TEST), each specifying the type, local IP, and ports for the specific service.

Usage Tips:
Server Configuration: Adjust the server's host, port, port range, Lua script path, and network interface settings as needed.
Client Configuration: Modify the client's server host, port, reconnect interval, and add/edit sections for different types of proxy connections (e.g., SSH, WEB, TEST) with their respective settings.
Refer to the provided examples as templates and adapt them according to your specific networking requirements. Ensure accurate file paths, IP addresses, and ports while configuring XProxy's server and client components based on your network setup.
